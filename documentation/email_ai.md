# Enhancing the AI Persona Using User Emails (PST Files)

Below is a step-by-step plan for leveraging user emails stored in PST files to improve the AI persona’s responses in ChatGenius. The high-level idea is to extract relevant text from the emails, convert that text into embeddings, store it in Pinecone, and then reference it using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach.

---

## 1. Extract and Parse PST Data

1. Use a PST parsing library or service (for instance, libpst or python-pst) to convert PST files into a portable format (e.g., JSON, individual EML files, or text).
2. For each parsed email, capture:
   - Sender and recipient addresses
   - Subject line or thread topic
   - Email body content
   - Timestamp, if relevant for ordering and context
3. Save these extracted emails in a staging directory or database. Ensure that content is cleaned (e.g., remove boilerplate signatures, disclaimers) while preserving essential context.

---

## 2. Data Privacy & Consent

1. Before ingestion, ensure that you have user permission to use their emails for AI training or retrieval.
2. Anonymize or remove sensitive information if the content is confidential or regulated (PII, personal details, etc.).
3. Provide an “opt in” mechanism as per your org’s policies and compliance requirements.

---

## 3. Transform Emails into Embeddings

1. Install and import the same embeddings model you currently use in the matrix-bot.ts (e.g., OpenAIEmbeddings).
2. For each email:
   - Concatenate the subject + body for a more complete context string.
   - Call the embeddings API to get a high-dimensional vector representation.
   - Assign a metadata dictionary that includes the email’s sender, topic, timestamp, and any relevant tags.

---

## 4. Store Embeddings in Pinecone

1. Use your Pinecone client to upsert vectors:
   - Vector: the embedding representation of the email text.
   - ID: a unique identifier (could be the email’s internal ID or a UUID).
   - Metadata: the structured fields (sender, subject, date, user ID, etc.).
2. Confirm that your Pinecone index has an appropriate dimension size matching the embeddings model.

---

## 5. Reference Emails in AI Persona

1. In matrix-bot.ts (or wherever you run your RAG logic), modify the “getContextualResponse” or a similar method to:

   - Convert an incoming user query into an embedding.
   - Query Pinecone for relevant email entries.
   - Retrieve the topK matches (e.g., top 3–5).
   - Insert these matched email bodies into your prompt as additional context.

2. Example prompt snippet:

   ```typescript:path/to/prompts/email-prompt.ts
   import { PromptTemplate } from '@langchain/core/prompts';

   export const emailPersonaPrompt = PromptTemplate.fromTemplate(`
     You are an AI persona with access to the user’s past emails for additional context.
     Use the following email excerpts to inform your response, but do not reference them explicitly as emails:

     Context:
     {email_context}

     Question:
     {user_query}
   `);
   ```

3. Add a personality “flair” or style if needed (e.g., referencing known writing style from the user’s email habits).

---

## 6. Integrate with the Chat Flow

1. Ensure that the AI funnel in matrix-bot.ts handles user mention or triggers:

   - If the bot sees “@myAI, can you respond about X?”
   - The bot calls “getContextualResponse(query).”
   - That function queries Pinecone for any relevant email data.
   - Merges the top emails into the new RAG prompt.
   - Feeds the enriched prompt to the ChatOpenAI model.
   - Posts the model’s answer back into the chat room.

2. Optionally add a fallback route if no relevant emails are returned (e.g., use a standard “helpful assistant” prompt).

---

## 7. Optional Fine-Tuning or Model Training

1. If you want to further refine the persona:

   - Gather user emails and user messages (with permission).
   - Use them in a fine-tuning dataset (e.g., OpenAI fine-tuning or another model’s fine-tuning approach).
   - Train the model to replicate the user’s writing style more precisely.
   - Replace or augment the standard ChatOpenAI model with the fine-tuned variant.

2. Keep in mind the costs and time requirements for regular fine-tuning, as well as user privacy.

---

## 8. Maintenance

1. Schedule periodic re-ingestion of new PST files or new emails.
2. Rebuild or update the Pinecone index with freshly embedded content.
3. Track token usage, cost, and performance metrics to ensure the system is running efficiently.

---

## Summary

By parsing emails from PST files, embedding them, storing them in Pinecone, and referencing them in a RAG pipeline, you can significantly enhance the AI persona’s accuracy and personalization. The persona will be able to reference past email context for more relevant and user-like responses, while remaining fully integrated with your existing matrix-bot.ts logic. Always remember to address privacy concerns, comply with data protection rules, and gather explicit user permission where required.
