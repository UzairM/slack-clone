# AI Implementation Plan

This document outlines the steps required to integrate AI capabilities into ChatGenius using the existing codebase (Matrix SDK, Next.js backend, LangChain-based approach, etc.). The plan is broken up into phases, reflecting the “Week 2 AI Objectives” and beyond.

---

## 1. AI Foundation

### 1.1 Set Up OpenAI API Integration

• Create an account and obtain an API key for OpenAI (if not already done).
• Store the API key securely (e.g., in environment variables such as OPENAI_API_KEY).
• Confirm that the “MatrixBot” constructor in app/src/lib/bot/matrix-bot.ts references this API key, or modify it so that it can be injected from environment variables.
• Test basic text completion or chat generation calls from OpenAI using the code pattern already in matrix-bot.ts (where ChatOpenAI is instantiated).

### 1.2 Configure LangChain.js

• Install and configure LangChain.js in the codebase (if not already done).
• Verify that ChatOpenAI, PromptTemplate, Document, and other classes from LangChain are working.
• Examine the existing chain definition in matrix-bot.ts (the RunnableSequence with a prompt template and a chat model). Confirm it’s properly returning results.
• Create a separate utility function or a service file in app/src/lib/ai/ that standardizes how LangChain calls are made, so other parts of the app can reuse it for tasks like generation, summarization, or question answering.

### 1.3 Implement AI Observability with Langfuse

• Install and configure the Langfuse SDK.
• Wrap the existing calls to ChatOpenAI or the RunnableSequence in matrix-bot.ts with Langfuse tracer objects.
• Confirm that you can view and debug AI calls (prompts, responses, tokens used, etc.) in the Langfuse dashboard.

### 1.4 Create Base Avatar System Architecture

• Define a model or database schema (via Prisma) to store “Avatar” or “Digital Twin” configurations (e.g., personality traits, voice options).
• Add a new route under Next.js or tRPC to manage avatar data.
• In the UI layer (e.g., a settings page), allow the user to create or update their AI avatar preferences.
• Optionally store references to image or video assets if you plan to do video-based avatars.

### 1.5 Set Up a RAG Pipeline for Context Awareness

• Use Pinecone (already partially integrated in matrix-bot.ts) for storing and retrieving relevant chat context.
• Ensure the “getContextualResponse” method can embed user queries, then retrieve topK context from Pinecone.
• Ingest older chat messages or relevant documentation (if desired) into Pinecone as well.
• Confirm results by verifying that newly posted chat messages can be retrieved as context.

### 1.6 Design Data Collection System for Potential Fine-Tuning

• Create an “opt-in” mechanism where user messages are allowed to be collected for potential model fine-tuning.
• Store these in a separate database table or in an S3 bucket for later retrieval.
• Ensure compliance with user privacy settings and GDPR guidelines if relevant.

### 1.7 Implement Prompt Engineering System

• Create a dedicated function or file (e.g., prompts.ts) defining the templates used to generate AI responses.
• Add or expand logic for different usage scenarios, such as “default response,” “summarization,” “explanations,” or “personality mirroring.”
• Use LangChain’s PromptTemplate to inject variables dynamically.

### 1.8 Create Prompt Templates for Different Contexts

• For each AI use case, define a unique prompt. Example contexts could be “meeting summary,” “user’s digital twin response,” or “public channel official announcement.”
• Add or refine fallback prompts if the system can’t retrieve enough context from Pinecone.
• Store these templates for easy future updates.

## 2. Core AI Features

### 2.1 Implement Chat History Analysis

• Hook into the Matrix client in app/src/hooks/use-matrix to fetch historical messages for a user or channel.
• Feed relevant messages into LangChain for summarization or reference.
• Provide a UI element (e.g., button) where a user can request “Summarize last 24h of this channel” or “Summarize this thread.”
• Use the existing Thread or channel logic to gather relevant messages.

### 2.2 Create Personality Mirroring System

• Extend the avatar data structure to include desired tone or style attributes (e.g., humor level, formality).
• In matrix-bot.ts, expand or replace the default prompt with a template that references the user’s style.
• Use examples from the user’s past messages (fetched from Pinecone or a local DB) to shape the AI’s responses (few-shot or RAG references).
• Test with user accounts sending typical messages to see if the AI picks up style or phrasing.

### 2.3 Build Context-Aware Response Generation

• In matrix-bot.ts, confirm that mention detection or question detection uses the “getContextualResponse” pipeline.
• If a user specifically addresses the AI avatar or types a trigger keyword (like “@myAI”), route the query to matrix-bot.ts.
• The “getContextualResponse” method returns an appropriately context-augmented response, using Pinecone for historical context.
• Optionally enable multi-turn memory by storing conversation state (in memory or short-term store) for that channel or DM.

### 2.4 Add Response Confidence Scoring

• Modify the chain or the final step in matrix-bot.ts to produce a confidence score (e.g., from the log probabilities in ChatOpenAI or a custom scoring prompt).
• Include that score in the AI’s posted message or as a hidden attribute in the user interface.
• Display a “Confidence: 80%” or similar marker in the chat if desired.

### 2.5 Implement Manual Override Functionality

• In the UI, create an override toggle so human users can finalize or edit an AI-generated response prior to sending.
• The AI might generate a draft message in a text box, allowing the user to revise or discard before posting.
• For fully automatic scenarios (like an away user), keep the flow as it is—bot sends directly without review.

## 3. Advanced AI Features

### 3.1 Voice & Video Synthesis

• When generating responses on behalf of the user, call external APIs (like Replicate, D-ID, or HeyGen) to create audio or video.
• Store or cache the generated media in your chosen file storage (S3, Vercel Blob Storage).
• Post a playable link or an embedded media component in the Matrix room.
• Handle rate limits and potential high latency from external generation services.

### 3.2 Avatar Customization

• Expand the database schema and UI so users can upload photos, choose avatars, or pick from generated visuals.
• Integrate the avatar system with the existing user profile in your Matrix client.
• Optionally allow for automated generation of digital likeness using the external avatar service (D-ID, for example).

### 3.3 Gesture & Expression Generation

• If using a video avatar system, request optional gestures or expressions from the external API.
• Map certain conversation contexts (like “happy,” “confused,” “emphasizing point”) to specified expressions.
• Provide an interface for the user to set how or when these expressions should be used.

### 3.4 Meeting Summarization

• Build a command or trigger (e.g., “/endmeeting”) that collects all messages from the start time to the end time of a meeting channel.
• Use a summarization chain (LangChain) to generate a short set of bullet points or action items.
• Post the summary message automatically to the channel or DM it to participants.
• Combine with the RAG pipeline if you wish to incorporate external docs or references.

## 4. Testing & Validation

### 4.1 Unit & Integration Tests

• Write unit tests for any new utility functions that perform embedding queries or specialized prompt logic.
• Ensure matrix-bot.ts logic is tested, especially for mention detection and correct message formatting.
• Use mocked responses from OpenAI/Pinecone in test environments to ensure deterministic results.

### 4.2 End-to-End Testing

• Perform manual and automated end-to-end tests of the AI flows:

1. Triggering AI from a user message
2. Checking if relevant context is retrieved from Pinecone
3. Generating a response using the correct prompt template
4. Posting that response to the relevant room in Matrix
   • For advanced features, confirm that voice/video files are uploaded successfully and playable.

### 4.3 Load & Performance Testing

• Evaluate how many concurrent AI calls can be handled if multiple users mention the bot at once.
• Stress test the Pinecone vector store with large queries.
• Monitor costs and performance metrics from OpenAI, Pinecone, and any avatar generation service.

## 5. Deployment & Monitoring

### 5.1 Deployment

• Ensure environment variables for AI services (OpenAI, Pinecone, Langfuse, D-ID, etc.) are set in the production environment.
• Confirm that the build process includes all relevant dependencies and does not unnecessarily bundle large AI libraries on the client.

### 5.2 Observability & Logging

• Confirm Langfuse is capturing logs/traces for all AI calls in production.
• Generate alerts if token usage or error rates exceed thresholds.
• Keep track of Pinecone indexing jobs and handle reindexing if needed.

### 5.3 Ongoing Maintenance

• Regularly update the prompt templates as user feedback is gathered.
• Consider advanced usage patterns (e.g., on-demand vs. always-on AI, user-level toggles).
• Plan for model fine-tuning or upgrading to new LLM versions.

## 6. Roadmap & Next Steps

1. Complete AI Foundation tasks (openAI integration, bot scaffolding).
2. Implement core AI features (context-aware responses, personality mirroring).
3. Release early version for user testing and gather feedback.
4. Extend to advanced AI features (voice/video, full avatar customization).
5. Iterate based on usage data and refine prompts, performance, and reliability.

This plan should enable a functional, AI-driven chat experience that leverages your existing Matrix-based codebase and third-party AI services for maximum impact.
